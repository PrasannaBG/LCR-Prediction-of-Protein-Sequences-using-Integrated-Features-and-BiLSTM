# A Integrated Features and BiLSTM Approach for Identification of Low Complexity Regions in Proteins

In initial stages, LCRs are considered as Junk peptides which in later stages discovered as vital player in cellular mechanisms such as phase separation and protein aggregation. This increases the necessity to identify LCR accurately in proteins to decode their biological relevance.Despite significant strides in both experimental and computational techniques, the precise identification and characterization of LCRs remain formidable challenges. 

Traditional tools, while effective, are often time-consuming and prone to inaccuracies in predicting LCRs. To address these limitations, the application of deep learning approaches has become increasingly promising. The primary objective of this research is to develop a Integrated Features approach with BERT and K-mer analysis that can grasp the amino acid composition and discover the LCR pattern from proteins, leading to more accurate identification of LCR.
